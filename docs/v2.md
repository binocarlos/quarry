# quarry v2

Move the cli to node

Save state into etcd

etcd auto-clustering

hq containers
 * graphite

base containers
 * etcd
 * monitor

This is the sensible dockerfile based quarry that does not try to get stuck in too much.

## basis

v1 was all about processing a yaml file which controls what happens when you deploy a stack.

The containers were built on the deploy server and the yaml was the only way to control a remote quarry.

## back to docker

Better - would be to define Dockerfiles for each node in the stack.

Each dockerfile would run in the root of the codebase.

It can either build the node from local code or it can pull code and build that way.

The important thing is that everything about the node is defined in the dockerfile and each dockerfile is copied to the root before the image is built.
