# quarry v2

This is the sensible dockerfile based quarry that does not try to get stuck in too much.

## basis

v1 was all about processing a yaml file which controls what happens when you deploy a stack.

The containers were built on the deploy server and the yaml was the only way to control a remote quarry.

## back to docker

Better - would be to define Dockerfiles for each node in the stack.

Each dockerfile would run in the root of the codebase.

It can either build the node from local code or it can pull code and build that way.

The important thing is that everything about the node is defined in the dockerfile and each dockerfile is copied to the root before the image is built.

## orchestration

The top level Quarryfile is Makefile format (it actually is a Makefile).

It creates arbritrary steps from bash commands - just like Make.

```
build: build_basenode build_db build_website

build_basenode:
	quarry build basenode appname/basenode

build_db:
	quarry build db appname/db

build_website:
	quarry build website appname/website
```
